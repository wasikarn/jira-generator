## Common Patterns (BEP Project)

### Find Stories by Sprint

```text
project = BEP AND type = Story AND sprint IN openSprints()
```

### Find Sub-tasks of Story

```text
parent = BEP-XXX
```

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** เมื่อใช้กับ MCP `jira_search` ห้ามใส่ ORDER BY ใน parent query!
>
> ```text
> ❌ parent = BEP-XXX ORDER BY created DESC  → Error: Expecting ')' but got 'ORDER'
> ✅ parent = BEP-XXX                        → ใช้งานได้
> ```
>
> ถ้าต้องการ sort ให้ใช้ `"Parent Link"` แทน:
>
> ```text
> ✅ "Parent Link" = BEP-XXX ORDER BY created DESC
> ```

### Find My Assigned Issues

```text
project = BEP AND assignee = currentUser() AND status != Done
```

### Find Unassigned Work

```text
project = BEP AND assignee IS EMPTY AND status = "To Do"
```

### Find Recently Updated

```text
project = BEP AND updated >= -7d ORDER BY updated DESC
```

### Find by Tag (Label)

```text
project = BEP AND labels = "BE"
project = BEP AND labels IN ("FE-Admin", "FE-Web")
```

### Find QA Sub-tasks

```text
project = BEP AND type = Sub-task AND summary ~ "[QA]"
```

### Find Epics

```text
project = BEP AND type = Epic AND status != Done
```

### Find Stories in Epic

```text
"Epic Link" = BEP-XXX AND type = Story
```

## Date Functions

```text
created >= -7d              # Last 7 days
updated >= startOfDay()     # Today
created >= startOfWeek()    # This week
created >= startOfMonth()   # This month
```

## User Functions

```text
assignee = currentUser()    # Me
reporter = currentUser()    # Created by me
```

## Sprint Functions

```text
sprint IN openSprints()     # Current sprint
sprint IN futureSprints()   # Future sprints
sprint IN closedSprints()   # Past sprints
```

---

## Order Results

```text
ORDER BY priority DESC              # Priority first
ORDER BY created DESC               # Newest first
ORDER BY updated DESC               # Recently active
ORDER BY duedate ASC               # Earliest due
ORDER BY priority DESC, created ASC # Combined
```

## Examples for /search-issues Command

| Use Case | JQL |
| --- | --- |
| Find story before creating | `project = BEP AND type = Story AND summary ~ "keyword"` |
| Check my sprint work | `project = BEP AND assignee = currentUser() AND sprint IN openSprints()` |
| Review sub-tasks | `"Parent Link" = BEP-XXX ORDER BY created` |
| Find blockers | `project = BEP AND priority = Highest AND status != Done` |
| Overdue items | `project = BEP AND duedate < now() AND status != Done` |
