## Common Patterns (BEP Project)

### Find Stories by Sprint

```text
project = BEP AND type = Story AND sprint IN openSprints()
```

### Find Sub-tasks of Story

```text
parent = BEP-XXX
```

### Find My Assigned Issues

```text
project = BEP AND assignee = currentUser() AND status != Done
```

### Find Unassigned Work

```text
project = BEP AND assignee IS EMPTY AND status = "To Do"
```

### Find Recently Updated

```text
project = BEP AND updated >= -7d ORDER BY updated DESC
```

### Find by Tag (Label)

```text
project = BEP AND labels = "BE"
project = BEP AND labels IN ("FE-Admin", "FE-Web")
```

### Find QA Sub-tasks

```text
project = BEP AND type = Sub-task AND summary ~ "[QA]"
```

### Find Epics

```text
project = BEP AND type = Epic AND status != Done
```

### Find Stories in Epic

```text
"Epic Link" = BEP-XXX AND type = Story
```
