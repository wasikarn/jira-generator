# /create-epic

**Role:** Senior Product Manager
**Output:** Epic in Jira + Epic Doc in Confluence

## Phases

### 1. Discovery

- Interview stakeholder: Problem? Target users? Business value? Success metrics?
- If existing docs available → read context
- **VS Planning:** Identify potential vertical slices (what distinct user flows exist?)
- **Gate:** Stakeholder confirms understanding

### 2. RICE Prioritization

- **R**each (1-10): Number of users affected
- **I**mpact (0.25-3): Level of impact on user
- **C**onfidence (0-100%): Confidence in estimate
- **E**ffort (person-weeks): Effort required
- Formula: `(R × I × C) / E`
- **Gate:** Stakeholder agrees with priority

### 3. Define Scope + VS Planning

- Identify high-level requirements
- **VS Pattern Selection:** (see [vertical-slice-guide.md](../shared-references/vertical-slice-guide.md))
  - Walking Skeleton? → `vs1-skeleton`
  - Enablers needed? → `vs-enabler`
  - Business rule splits? → `vs2-*`, `vs3-*`
- Break into User Stories by VS (draft):
  - vs1-skeleton: Story A, Story B
  - vs2-{rule}: Story C, Story D
- Define MVP: Which VS are must-have vs nice-to-have?
- Identify Dependencies and Risks
- **Gate:** Stakeholder approves scope + VS plan

### 4. Quality Gate (MANDATORY)

Before sending to Atlassian, score against `shared-references/verification-checklist.md`:

1. Report: `Technical X/5 | Quality X/6 | Overall X%`
2. If < 90% → auto-fix issues → re-score (max 2 attempts)
3. If >= 90% → proceed to create/edit
4. If still < 90% after fix → ask user before proceeding
5. After Atlassian write → `cache_invalidate(issue_key)` if cache server available

### 5. Create Artifacts

1. **Epic Doc** → `MCP: confluence_create_page(space_key: "{{PROJECT_KEY}}")`
   - Include VS Map table in Epic Doc
2. **Epic** → `acli jira workitem create --from-json tasks/epic.json`
   - Add labels: feature label + `vs-planned`
3. **Link** Epic to Doc

### 6. Handoff

```text
## Epic Created: [Title] ({{PROJECT_KEY}}-XXX)
RICE Score: X | Stories: N planned
Epic Doc: [link] | Epic: [link]
→ Use /create-story to continue
```

## Epic Structure (ADF)

| Section | Panel Type | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🎯 Epic Overview | `info` | Summary + scope statement |
| 💰 Business Value | `success` | Revenue, Retention, Operations |
| 📦 Scope | `info` + table | Features/modules breakdown |
| 📊 RICE Score | table | R/I/C/E + final score |
| 🎯 Success Metrics | table | KPIs + targets |
| 📋 User Stories | `info` panels | Grouped by feature area |
| 📈 Progress | `note` | Done/In Progress/To Do counts |
| 🔗 Links | table | Epic Doc, Technical Notes |

**ADF Restrictions:**

- ❌ Do not nest tables inside panels (will error)
- ✅ Use paragraphs or bulletList inside panels instead
