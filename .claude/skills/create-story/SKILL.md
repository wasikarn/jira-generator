# /create-story

**Role:** Senior Product Owner
**Output:** User Story in Jira with ADF format

## Context Object (accumulated across phases)

| Phase | Adds to Context |
|-------|----------------|
| 1. Discovery | `epic_data`, `vs_assignment`, `user_requirements`, `user_context` |
| 2. Write Story | `story_narrative`, `acs[]`, `scope`, `dod` |
| 3. INVEST | `invest_score`, `vs_validated` |
| 4. QG | `qg_score`, `passed_qg` |
| 5. Create | `story_key` ({{PROJECT_KEY}}-XXX) |

> **Workflow Patterns:** See [workflow-patterns.md](../shared-references/workflow-patterns.md) for Gate Levels (AUTO/REVIEW/APPROVAL), QG Scoring, Two-Step, and Explore patterns.

## Phases

> **Phase Tracking:** Use TodoWrite to mark each phase `in_progress` → `completed` as you work.

### 1. Discovery

- If Epic exists → `MCP: jira_get_issue` to read context + VS plan + Problem narrative
- Ask user: Who? What? Why? Constraints?
  - **Story Context:** What is the user currently doing? What's difficult? (for 📍 context line)
- **VS Assignment:** Which vertical slice does this story belong to? (`vs1-skeleton`, `vs2-*`, `vs-enabler`)
- **⛔ GATE — DO NOT PROCEED** without user confirmation of requirements + VS assignment.

### 2. Write Story

```text
📍 [User's current situation — what they're doing, what's difficult]  ⚡ optional
As a [persona],
I want to [action],
So that [benefit].
```

- ⚡ **Context line:** Include when persona is new or workflow is complex — not needed for every story
- Define ACs: Given/When/Then format
- **AC Naming:** Use `AC{N}: [Verb] — [Scenario Name]` (not just "AC1: Title")
- Specify Scope (affected services) and DoD
- **VS Check:** Story delivers end-to-end value? All layers touched? (not shell-only or layer-split)
- Use Thai + transliteration
- **🟡 REVIEW** — Present story narrative, ACs, scope to user. Proceed unless user objects.

### 3. INVEST + VS Validation

| ✓ | Criteria | Question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | Independent | Not dependent on other stories? |
| | Negotiable | Room for discussion? |
| | Valuable | Clear business value? |
| | Estimable | Can estimate effort? |
| | **Small + Vertical** | Completable in 1 sprint? **End-to-end slice?** |
| | Testable | All ACs verifiable in isolation? |

**VS Anti-pattern Check:**

- ❌ Shell-only (UI has no logic) → Add minimal happy path
- ❌ Layer-split (BE separated from FE) → Combine into single story
- ❌ Tab-split → Split by business rule instead

**🟢 AUTO** — Validate all criteria. If any fail or VS anti-pattern detected → auto-fix and re-validate. Escalate to user only if unfixable.

### 4. Quality Gate (MANDATORY)

> **🟢 AUTO** — Score → auto-fix → re-score. Escalate only if still < 90% after 2 attempts.
> HR1: DO NOT send Story to Atlassian without QG ≥ 90%.

> [QG Scoring Rules](../shared-references/workflow-patterns.md#quality-gate-scoring). Report: `Technical X/5 | Story Quality X/6 | Overall X%`

### 5. Create in Jira

> **🟢 AUTO** — If QG passed → create automatically. No user interaction needed.

```bash
acli jira workitem create --from-json tasks/story.json
```

- ADF: Info panel (narrative) + Success panels (ACs)
- **Labels (MANDATORY):**
  - Feature label: `coupon-web`, `credit-topup`, etc.
  - VS label: `vs1-skeleton`, `vs2-credit-e2e`, `vs-enabler`, etc.
  - See convention: [Vertical Slice Guide](../shared-references/vertical-slice-guide.md)

> **🟢 AUTO** — HR6: `cache_invalidate(story_key)` after create.

### 6. Handoff

```text
## Story Created: [Title] ({{PROJECT_KEY}}-XXX)
ACs: N | Scope: [services]
→ Use /analyze-story {{PROJECT_KEY}}-XXX to continue
```
