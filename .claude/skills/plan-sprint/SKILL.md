# /plan-sprint

**Role:** Scrum Master + Sprint Planner (Tresor-powered)
**Output:** Sprint plan with assignments executed in Jira

## Pre-Meeting Checklist

> See [Sprint Frameworks](../shared-references/sprint-frameworks.md) for full details

- [ ] **Timebox set:** 45 min × weeks (e.g., 2-week sprint = 90 min)
- [ ] **PO prepared:** Backlog refined, top items have ACs
- [ ] **Team prepared:** Capacity conflicts identified, carry-over updated
- [ ] **Sprint goal draft:** SMART format ready

## ⚠️ Critical: Capacity Before Assignment

> **Always calculate team capacity BEFORE assigning individual tasks.**
> This prevents over-committing sprints and ensures balanced workload distribution.

**Order of Operations:**

1. Calculate total team capacity (Phase 2)
2. Prioritize backlog items (Phase 4)
3. THEN assign to individuals (Phase 5)

**Anti-Pattern:** Assigning work to individuals first → leads to unbalanced sprints, burnout, missed commitments

## Context Object (accumulated across phases)

| Phase | Adds to Context |
|-------|----------------|
| 1. Discovery | `source_sprint`, `target_sprint`, `sprint_items[]` |
| 2. Capacity | `capacity_table[]`, `available_slots[]` |
| 3. Carry-over | `carry_over_items[]`, `probability_scores[]` |
| 4. Prioritize | `prioritized_items[]`, `vs_validated` |
| 5. Distribute | `assignment_map[]`, `workload_table` |
| 6. Risk | `risk_flags[]`, `mitigations[]` |
| 7. Review | `approved_plan` |
| 8. Execute | `execution_log[]`, `assigned_keys[]` |

> **Workflow Patterns:** See [workflow-patterns.md](../shared-references/workflow-patterns.md) for Gate Levels (AUTO/REVIEW/APPROVAL), QG Scoring, Two-Step, and Explore patterns.

## Part A: Data Collection (Phases 1-2) — Execution Layer

> **Phase Tracking:** Use TodoWrite to mark each phase `in_progress` → `completed` as you work.

### 1. Sprint Discovery

Ask the user:

- Which target sprint? (if not specified → find the next future sprint)
- Which source sprint for carry-over? (if not specified → current active sprint)

```text
MCP: jira_get_sprint_issues(sprint_id="<source>", fields="summary,status,assignee,priority,issuetype")
MCP: jira_get_sprint_issues(sprint_id="<target>", fields="summary,status,assignee,priority,issuetype")
```

**Collect:**

- Source sprint: items + statuses + assignees (carry-over candidates)
- Target sprint: existing items (already planned)
- Sprint dates + goals

**🟡 REVIEW** — Present data summary to user. Proceed unless user objects.

### 2. Team Capacity

```text
Read: .claude/skills/shared-references/team-capacity.md
```

**Calculate per person:**

- Max capacity (items/sprint from budget)
- Already assigned (target sprint items)
- Available slots = max - already assigned

**Output:** Capacity table

| Member | Role | Budget | Assigned | Available |
| -------- | ------ | -------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**🟡 REVIEW** — Present capacity table to user. Proceed unless user objects.

## Part B: Strategy Analysis (Phases 3-6) — Tresor Layer

> **Phase Tracking:** Use TodoWrite to mark each phase `in_progress` → `completed` as you work.
> **🟢 AUTO** — Phases 3-6 delegate to Tresor sprint-prioritizer. All automated. Escalate only if Tresor agent returns incomplete data.

> Phases 3-6 delegate to Tresor sprint-prioritizer via Task agent
> Agent reads: team-capacity.md + sprint-frameworks.md + sprint data from Phase 1

```text
Task(subagent_type: "general-purpose", prompt: """
You are a sprint planning strategist. Read and apply the frameworks from:
- .claude/skills/shared-references/sprint-frameworks.md (RICE, Impact/Effort, carry-over model)
- .claude/skills/shared-references/team-capacity.md (team roster, capacity, skill mapping)

Also reference Tresor sprint-prioritizer methodology from:
- ~/.claude/subagents/product/management/sprint-prioritizer/agent.md

## Sprint Data
[Insert Phase 1 data: source sprint items, target sprint items, statuses, assignees]

## Tasks
1. **Carry-over Analysis:** Calculate carry-over probability using the status-based model
2. **Prioritization:** Rank items using the Impact/Effort matrix (skip RICE if insufficient data)
3. **Workload Distribution:** Match items → team members based on skill match + capacity
4. **Risk Assessment:** Flag overloads, dependencies, blockers

## Output Format
### Carry-over Summary
| Key | Summary | Status | Probability | Assignee |
### Prioritized Items
| Priority | Key | Summary | Quadrant | Reason |
### Recommended Assignments
| Member | Carry-over | New | Total | Budget | Risk Flag |
### Risk Flags
| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
""")
```

### 3. Carry-over Analysis

**Input:** Source sprint items with statuses
**Method:** Status-based probability model (from sprint-frameworks.md)

**Output:**

- Estimated carry-over count per person
- High-probability items (>80%) → auto-include in target sprint
- Medium-probability items (45-80%) → flag for user decision

### 4. Prioritization + Story Structure Validation

**Validate stories are vertical slices** (see [Sprint Frameworks](../shared-references/sprint-frameworks.md#vertical-slicing)):

- [ ] Each story delivers end-to-end user value (not just one layer)
- [ ] Shell-only stories reframed as Walking Skeleton
- [ ] VS labels assigned (`vs{N}-{name}`, `vs-enabler`, `{feature}-{scope}`)

**Input:** Target sprint items + new items to add
**Method:** Impact vs Effort matrix

**Output:**

- P1 (DO FIRST): High impact, low effort
- P2 (PLAN CAREFULLY): High impact, high effort
- P3 (QUICK WINS): Low impact, low effort
- P4 (DEFER): Low impact, high effort

### 5. Workload Distribution

**Input:** Prioritized items + team capacity + carry-over
**Method:** Skill match → existing context → capacity check → grouping

**Rules:**

- Related items → same person (reduce context switching)
- Blockers → prioritize (unblock others)
- Critical path → senior/lead
- Never exceed capacity ceiling

**Output:** Assignment recommendation table

### 6. Risk Assessment

**Check:**

- [ ] No one exceeds capacity ceiling
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Critical path items have an owner
- [ ] Junior devs have mentor support
- [ ] No one has >3 sticky carry-over items

**Output:** Risk flags with severity + mitigation

## Part C: Approval & Execution (Phases 7-8) — Execution Layer

> **Phase Tracking:** Use TodoWrite to mark each phase `in_progress` → `completed` as you work.

### 7. Sprint Plan Review ⚠️ GATE

Present the complete sprint plan to the user:

```text
## Sprint Plan: [Sprint Name]
📅 [Start Date] → [End Date]
🎯 Sprint Goal: [goal]

### Team Workload
| Member | Carry-over | New | Total | Budget | Status |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 🟢/⚠️/🔴 |

### Items to Assign
| # | Key | Summary | Assignee | Priority | Action |
| 1 | {{PROJECT_KEY}}-XXX | ... | Name | P1 | assign + move |

### Risk Summary
| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |

### Deferred Items (not included in this sprint)
| Key | Summary | Reason |
```

**⛔ GATE -- DO NOT EXECUTE** any assignments without user approval of the complete sprint plan.

### 8. Execute Assignments

> **🟢 AUTO** — If Phase 7 approved → execute all assignments automatically. Escalate only on failure.
> HR7: Sprint ID must be looked up dynamically. NEVER hardcode sprint IDs.

Execute according to the user-approved plan:

```text
# Move items to target sprint (⚠️ sprint field = plain number, NOT object)
MCP: jira_update_issue(issue_key="{{PROJECT_KEY}}-XXX", additional_fields={"{{SPRINT_FIELD}}": 123})

# Assign items (⚠️ MCP assignee silent fail — use acli instead)
Bash: acli jira workitem assign -k "{{PROJECT_KEY}}-XXX" -a "email@domain.com" -y
```

> ⚠️ Sprint field uses `{{SPRINT_FIELD}}` with plain number (e.g. `123`) — do not use `{"id": 123}`
> **🟢 AUTO** — HR3: NEVER set assignee via MCP. Use `acli jira workitem assign -k "KEY" -a "email" -y`.
> **🟢 AUTO** — HR6: `cache_invalidate(issue_key)` after EVERY sprint assignment.

**Output:**

```text
## Sprint Planning Complete ✅
Sprint: [Name] (ID: XXX)
Items assigned: XX
Team members: XX

### Execution Log
| # | Key | Action | Status |
| 1 | {{PROJECT_KEY}}-XXX | Assigned to Name + moved to sprint | ✅ |

→ To verify: /verify-issue {{PROJECT_KEY}}-XXX
→ To update a story: /update-story {{PROJECT_KEY}}-XXX
```

## Options

| Flag | Description |
| ------ | ------------- |
| `--sprint <id>` | Specify target sprint ID (if not specified → find the next future sprint) |
| `--carry-over-only` | Carry-over analysis only (no assign/move) — Phase 1-3 only |
