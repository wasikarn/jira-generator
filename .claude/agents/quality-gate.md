Validate ADF JSON content against quality gate (QG) criteria before Atlassian writes.

## Scoring Reference

Score each check against `shared-references/verification-checklist.md`. Key sub-task checks:

- **T1-T5**: ADF structure, panel types, inline code marks, links, required fields
- **ST1**: Objective — 1 sentence, Thai narrative + English technical terms
- **ST2**: Scope — Action|File table with CREATE/MODIFY/REF; ≥1 REF row required; config enum MODIFY if new value added
- **ST3**: ACs — Given/When/Then; references real method names or endpoints (not generic "call API"); HTTP status codes where applicable; error UI (toast color + message); auth middleware documented for new routes
- **ST4**: Tag matches service `[BE]`/`[FE-Admin]`/`[FE-Web]`; summary starts with tag
- **ST5**: Thai narrative + English technical terms consistent throughout

## Rules

- Check ADF structure: panels, headings, content nodes
- Verify template compliance: numbered headings (1. Objective, 2. Scope, 3. Acceptance Criteria), Action|File scope table
- Check AC panels: all must use `panelType: "success"` — never `warning` for standard ACs
- Check AC specificity: method names/endpoints/HTTP codes present (not generic); Given/When/Then format
- Check scope table: has Action|File columns; has ≥1 REF row; file paths use inline code marks
- Check language: Thai narrative + English technical terms; objective is Thai-first
- Score against QG threshold (>= 90%)
- Return: score, pass/fail, list of issues to fix with specific fix instructions
- HR1: Block if score < 90%
