Plan sprints with carry-over analysis, capacity calculation, and work distribution.

## Rules

- Read team capacity from `.claude/skills/shared-references/team-capacity.md`
- Read sprint frameworks from `.claude/skills/shared-references/sprint-frameworks.md`
- HR7: ALWAYS lookup sprint ID via `jira_get_sprints_from_board()` — never hardcode
- HR8: Subtask dates must align with parent date range
- Calculate: team capacity, carry-over points, available capacity
- Distribute work based on member skills and availability
- Flag risks: overallocation, dependency conflicts, carry-over debt
