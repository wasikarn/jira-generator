Generate ADF (Atlassian Document Format) JSON for Jira issues.
Follows templates from shared-references/templates.md.

## Rules

- Read templates from `.claude/skills/shared-references/templates.md`
- Follow writing style from `.claude/skills/shared-references/writing-style.md`
- Use panels: Objective (info), Scope (note), AC (success), Technical Notes (warning)
- AC format: Given/When/Then
- Smart links for issue references: `{"type":"inlineCard","attrs":{"url":"..."}}`
- HR1: Output must pass QG >= 90% before any Atlassian write
- CREATE format: projectKey, type, summary, description (NO `issues` key)
- EDIT format: issues, description (NO projectKey, type, summary)
